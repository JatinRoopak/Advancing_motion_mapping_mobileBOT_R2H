🌐 Advancing Motion Mapping MobileBOT R2H

🕹️ Project Overview

Advancing Motion Mapping MobileBOT R2H is a beginner-friendly project that starts with the basics of robotics. It is designed to develop one or multiple robots capable of efficiently mapping their environment. Prior to deploying the robots for real-world mapping, we test their functionality and visualization capabilities using Gazebo and Rviz simulation tools.

🎨 Current Capabilities

This project currently offers the following features:

🔹 Static Visualization in Rviz: View your robot in a static environment, providing insights into its configuration and data output.

🌐 Static Simulation in Gazebo: Simulate the robot in a static environment, validating its physical design and behavior.

These capabilities serve as the foundation for further advancements in robotic mapping and testing processes.

📄 Pre-Setup Information

📚 1. Setup of Files

When you build your ROS package using colcon build for the first time, the following essential files and folders will be generated:

📁 Package folder: Named after your package.

📝 setup.py: Handles package configuration and installation.

📝 package.xml: Contains metadata about the package.

📂 resource folder: Stores additional package-related files.

Optionally, you may also find LICENSE and README text files.
